This is a project for Advanced Time Series Forecasting and Analysis. The repository offers a comprehensive approach to time series analysis and forecasting, primarily utilizing classical statistical models such as ARIMA and SARIMA. All analytical metrics and predictions are consolidated and presented within an interactive dashboard for straightforward interpretation. This project goes beyond simple visualization to provide deep analytical insights and robust forecasting capabilities.

Key features include an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase, which involves Stationarity Checks using tests like Augmented Dickey-Fuller, Seasonal Decomposition to break the series into Trend, Seasonal, and Residual components, and the calculation and visualization of Rolling Statistics, specifically Rolling Mean and Standard Deviation, for visual confirmation of stationarity over time.

For Classical Forecasting Models, we employed established techniques for accurate prediction: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is used for non-seasonal data, with parameter optimization (p, d, q) based on ACF and PACF plots and grid search; and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), which extends the ARIMA model to handle time series with clear seasonality, optimizing seasonal parameters (P, D, Q, m).

The project features an Interactive Dashboard Visualization built to consolidate all analyses and predictions. This includes Model Comparison, visualizing the actual data against both ARIMA and SARIMA forecasts; Residual Analysis charts showing the distribution and fit of the model's errors; Dynamic Range Selection allowing users to filter data and forecasts by specific time periods; and displaying Performance Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for model evaluation.

To set up the project environment, you need Python 3.8+ and pip. Begin by Cloning the Repository using git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/time-series-analysis-project.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/time-series-analysis-project.git) and navigating to the directory. It is highly recommended to Create and Activate a Virtual Environment by running python -m venv venv, then activating it with source venv/bin/activate (Linux/macOS) or .\venv\Scripts\activate (Windows). Then, Install Dependencies by executing pip install -r requirements.txt. These dependencies are assumed to include necessary libraries like pandas, statsmodels, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and dashboard libraries like Dash or Streamlit.

To use the project, you can re-run the model training and save new forecast data by running the analysis script: python scripts/analyze_time_series.py. This script is responsible for generating model output and storing it in a file like data/forecast_results.csv, which the dashboard then reads. To Launch the Dashboard, run the main application file: python app.py. Once the command runs, open your web browser and navigate to the local server address displayed in the console (typically http://127.0.0.1:8050/). The repository structure contains a data/ directory with raw_data.csv and forecast_results.csv, a scripts/ directory with analyze_time_series.py, and top-level files app.py, requirements.txt, and the README.md. Contributions are welcome, whether in the form of suggestions for new analysis techniques, better parameter tuning, or improvements to the dashboard UI; please open an issue or submit a pull request.
